File_2_uIP_Converter
====================

A simple utility to convert a given file into a valid C array used by the uIP TCP/IP stack.

This may be useful to people who work on Windows and don't want to or canÂ´t install perl.

For now this utility is best used with HTML files but other files may be used.

Future

	- Add batch support.
	- Make use of async/await
